<p>On the 7th of March 2019 we went axe throwing for our team event. After that we went to A Beautiful Mess where we enjoyed delicious food in a special place: the launderette of the former Bijlmer Bajes. Drinking alcohol loosened our tongues and we talked about many random nerdy topics, as usual. Going to Mars, Dungeons & Dragons, consciousness and much more. There must be something special that they put in the drinks.</p>
