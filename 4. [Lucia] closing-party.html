<p>January 10th 2020. Things have never been the same again after January 10th 2020. Hemweg coal plant shut down and we celebrated big time. The celebration was unforgettable. The location, the lights, the bar, the music, everything was truly unforgettable. Yeah, the Music.  No one will forget the music that was played that night. Such an amazing line-up. BUT. Only one band had the honour to partnership with a real Guitar Hero, a Star whose name will always be part of the firmament. The stairway to heaven was finally unveiled that night. <p>
